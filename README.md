# 1. Added a loop for time, and made the player check their watch during some knots to progress the loop.
  2. Added a suggestion for the player to go get the torch in the east and west tunnels if they didn't already get it.
  3. Added the how mirror dimension part to make the story more interesting, create a lose condition, and give the player a major choice.
  4. Added an alternate, better ending for players that made it through the mirror dimension part.
